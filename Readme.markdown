##Description:
Simulo is designed to make it easier to test your sproutcore
applications in pure javascript by providing a way to easily simulate
common events from the browser without having to use the Sproutcore
event objects directly. 

##Installation

To setup fictum to work in your SproutCore project, we need to add the framework to your application.

    $ cd <your sproutcore project's root directory>
    $ mkdir frameworks # if you don't already have a frameworks folder
    $ cd frameworks
    $ git clone git://github.com/gmoeck/simulo.git
